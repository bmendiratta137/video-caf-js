# New Relic CAF Tracker

New Relic video tracking for CAF Receivers.

## Requirements

This video monitor solutions can work both, on top of New Relic's **Browser Agent** or standalone.

## Build

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

And build:

```
$ npm run build:dev
```

Or if you need a production build:

```
$ npm run build
```

## Usage

Load **scripts** inside `dist` folder into your page.

```html
<script src="../dist/newrelic-caf.min.js"></script>
```

> If `dist` folder is not included, run `npm i && npm run build` to build it.

If **NOT** using the New Relic Browser Agent, add this line of code:

```javascript
nrvideo.Core.setBackend(new nrvideo.NRInsightsBackend("ACCOUNT ID", "API KEY"));
```

To initialize the backend you need an ACCOUNT ID and an API KEY.

The ACCOUNT ID indicates the New Relic account to which you would like to send the Chromecast data. For example, https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/xxx. Where “xxx” is the Account ID.

To register the API Key, follow the instructions found [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api/).

Finally, init the CAF tracker:

```javascript
nrvideo.Core.addTracker(new nrvideo.CAFTracker());
```

## Examples

Check out the `samples` folder for complete usage examples.

## Known Limitations

- When not using the New Relic Browser Agent, some attributes are missing, like `ASN` or `country`. See the full list [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary/?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8302&event=PageAction).
- Due to the way the chromecast player works, when an `END` happens, the `contentSrc` attribute is incorrect.
